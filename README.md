# IDS Database

This repository holds an IDS database based on the BabelStone IDS database.

A few helper scripts are also included in this repository.
They allow to check for completeness and consistency of the database.

Only a few minor changes to the original database were introduced by myself (Omar L.),
to allow integration with my [HanCharTools](https://github.com/omulh/HanCharTools).
The vast mayority of the work on the database itself should be attributed to Andrew West (魏安).

## BabelStone IDS Database

The BabelStone IDS database is a plain text listing (encoded as UTF-8) of Ideographic Description Sequences (IDS)
for all encoded CJK Unified Ideographs. The original file can be downloaded [here](https://www.babelstone.co.uk/CJK/IDS.TXT).

Under U.S. copyright law, data (i.e. a collection of facts) is not eligible to copyright protection (see
<https://sco.library.emory.edu/research-data-management/publishing/copyright-data.html>), and as IDS descriptions
for CJK ideographs are facts not original creative compositions, IDS sequences in themselves are not eligible for
copyright protection (that is to say, you could no more copyright 彼 = ⿰彳皮 than you could copyright 1 + 1 = 2).
Therefore, anyone is free to make use of the IDS data provided in this file for personal or commercial purposes
without asking permission or providing attribution. I furthermore waive any copyright claims to the presentation
format of the IDS data used in this file, so anyone is free to fork the file, or use it as the basis for a new
IDS data set.
