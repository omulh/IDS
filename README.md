The BabelStone IDS database is a plain text listing (encoded as UTF-8) of Ideographic Description Sequences (IDS) for
all encoded CJK Unified Ideographs. The original file is maintained by Andrew West (魏安) (babelstone@gmail.com), to
whom any corrections should be directed. The original file can be downloaded from: https://www.babelstone.co.uk/CJK/IDS.TXT

Under U.S. copyright law, data (i.e. a collection of facts) is not eligible to copyright protection (see
<https://sco.library.emory.edu/research-data-management/publishing/copyright-data.html>), and as IDS descriptions
for CJK ideographs are facts not original creative compositions, IDS sequences in themselves are not eligible for
copyright protection (that is to say, you could no more copyright 彼 = ⿰彳皮 than you could copyright 1 + 1 = 2).
Therefore, anyone is free to make use of the IDS data provided in this file for personal or commercial purposes
without asking permission or providing attribution. I furthermore waive any copyright claims to the presentation
format of the IDS data used in this file, so anyone is free to fork the file, or use it as the basis for a new
IDS data set.
